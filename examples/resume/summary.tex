	I'm a Technologist with 15+ years into the IT industry, with solid experience as Senior backend developer both in Java and Python; looking for a change into the Quality Assurance field, its automation and continous improvement. This bold change is motivated by understanding my own nature, my passion for coding, my compromise with excellence; and how to apply them towards making significative value to my stakeholders.

	My formation as bugfixer, made me undestand the importance of the diverse aspects of quality around software, and how they contribute along the maintenance cycle,  specially when critical response is required, helping to ease diagnose and provision of solutions, in form of workarounds and fixes. Also my experience through the diverse industries I've served for, such as Banking and Financial Services, Retail, Automotive, and IT among others, forged me as an adaptative person, eagering for quick and reliable fit into the teams I've worked in.
