\cvsubsection{Coding} % Category

\begin{cvparagraph}
	I've worked as developer mainly in Java, from versions 1.4 up t 12; from backend (Hibernate, Spring MVC and Boot) and Web (Servlets, Struts, JSP and JSF) to frontend (Swing, SWT and JavaFX 1.x and 2.x). I also have solid experience on Python 3.x, mainly for web applications (Django), web services (Flask) and data analysis (numpy, pandas and SQL Alchemy). Even though I'm more experienced in backend tasks, I also have knowledge of Javascript and TypeScript, Angular and React to work on Frontend development. Also, as a daily user of POSIX OSes,
	Mac OS X and Linux, i'm used to sh/bash/zsh scripting and ssh for remote workflows.

\cvsubsection{CI/CD and Quality} % Category

\begin{cvparagraph}
	I have solid experience working with JUnit, pyUnit and pyTest to build test cases and suites, and also setting up repeatable testing scenarios, such capturing and shrinking database snapshots and instance mocking on state-sensitive cases. Also I've been working with Jenkins and its predecessor, Hudson, to build CI/CD pipelines; and both Git and Subversion to strengten through pre-commit hooks and checks, validations like code linting and smoke tests. Also, I'm familiar with quality reporting tools, such as SonarQube, PMD, JSL to detect flaws. I'm also familiar with UI testing tools such as Selenium and profilers such as JProfiler.
\end{cvparagraph}

\cvsubsection{Agile methodologies}

\begin{cvparagraph}
	I've worked into Agile projects long part of my career, knowing and put into practice the concepts of Scrum, Extreme Programming (XP) and Kanban, also working on hybrid environments, adapting concepts to fit into the companies culture and teams' needs. Also, I'm convinced of the use of KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and OKRs (Objective Key Results) to set and track both personal and project results.
\end{cvparagraph}

\cvsubsection{Emotional Intelligence}

\begin{cvparagraph}
	I've forged my resiliency through my constant search of excellence, combined with self-criticism and "hands-on" attitude, helps me to thrive through fears instead of fighting against them; and my concepts of leadership helps me to understand the nature of needs, assume the needed role into team, and contribute towards success. Also, I'm convinced that opportunities have to be discovered and dive through them instead of waiting for them.
